# GB Studio 3.2 - Plugin Pak

A set of experimental plugins for GB Studio 3.2. Use them at your own risk :)

## Dialogue & Menus

### Display Advanced Dialogue

Show a dialogue box at the bottom of the game screen.

The `Text` tab behaves exactly like the **Display Dialogue** event.

The `Layout` tab allows to configure multiple options for the dialogue box:

- Minimum and maximum height of the display box, and if the border should be rendered or not.
- The starting position of the text.
- The maxmimum number of lines before the text will start scrolling up.
- Configure when the dialogue will close:
  - When a button is pressed
  - When the text finishes rendering
  - Never (the dialogue box will remain on screen and allow other interactions. The dialogue can be hidden using the **Hide Overlay** or **Overlay Move To** events).
- If the previous content should be removed when displaying the dialogue. This is useful to avoid the text flickering when dialogue boxes are open with Instant speed.
- If the dialogue should render at the bottom or the top of the screen. (_Note:_ Pay attention to the warnings on the event when using top position)

### Display Advanced Menu

Display a menu of multiple options and set the specified variable to the value of the chosen option.

Menu option position and navigation order can be set for each item in the `Items` tab. The dialogue box size and the opening and closing direction can be set in the `Layout` tab.

There's no maximum character length per item, but the total amount of displayed characters is limited to by the number of tiles reserved for UI text (52 for non-color mode).

_Note:_ The event can get very long when there's a lot of items.

### Display Background Text

Renders a line of text at a specified position in the scene background.

There's no maximum character length for the text, but the total amount of displayed characters in a scene is limited to by the number of tiles reserved for UI text (52 for non-color mode), this includes text displayed with this event but also any other dialogue or menu.

Unfortunately, autocomplete of variables isn't available for single line textboxes in plugins. Use `$xxx$` to render a variable as part of the text, for example `$100` to render the value of `Variable 100`.

## Printer

_Note:_ The embedded GB Studio emulator doesn't have support for printing, this event will always fail when tested there. Use a real device or an emulator with printer support.

### Print Screen Background

Prints the visible background of the current scene using GB Printer. In Color Mode the CPU will be set to Single-speed mode while the event is running.

* **On Error:** A script to run if there's an error when trying to print.

## Real Time Clock

A set of events that give access to the Real Time Clock functionality present in some GB cartridges.

_Note:_ Cartridge type needs to be set to `MBC3` in the project Settings, for RTC to work.

### Set Clock Time

Set the values of the real time clock fields with a number or the value of a variable.

## Î² Plugins

The plugins in this category are even more experimental than the ones above and might change in the future.

- **Move Variable Actor To and Store Variable Actor Position In Variables**:
  - These events duplicate existing GB Studio Actor events but instead of using a dropdown to select the actor they use a variable. The value of the variable represents the index of the actor in the scene (the player is always `0` and the rest of the actors have an index assigned based on when they were added to the scene).
- **Actor FX**:
  - Run visual effects on an actor. Currently only Split In / Split Out effects are implemented. More to come (maybe?).
- **Locked Event Group and Unlocked Event Group**:
  - Lock or unlock the executuon of parts of your script. A locked script doesn't allow other scripts to run in parallel.
- **Pin Actor to Screen and Unpin Actor from Screen**:
  - Pin or Unpin the actor to its current screen coordinates. Be aware of the current state of the actor: If it's already pinned or unpinned when the event is called its position will be wrongly offset based on the scroll position.

## How to Install

Drop the `plugins` folder in your project. All the above events will be available from the `Add Event` button.
